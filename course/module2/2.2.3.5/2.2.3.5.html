        <h1>Selecting a WAN Technology</h1>
        <h2>Public WAN Infrastructure</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="content">
          <p>Security risks are incurred when a teleworker or a remote office worker uses broadband services to access the corporate WAN over the Internet. To address security concerns, broadband services provide capabilities for using VPN connections to a VPN server, which is typically located at the corporate site. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A VPN is an encrypted connection between private networks over a public network, such as the Internet. Instead of using a dedicated Layer 2 connection, such as a leased line, a VPN uses virtual connections called VPN tunnels, which are routed through the Internet from the private network of the company to the remote site or employee host. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Benefits of VPN include the following:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Cost savings </b>- VPNs enable organizations to use the global Internet to connect remote offices and remote users to the main corporate site, thus eliminating expensive, dedicated WAN links and modem banks.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Security </b>- VPNs provide the highest level of security by using advanced encryption and authentication protocols that protect data from unauthorized access. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Scalability </b>- Because VPNs use the Internet infrastructure within ISPs and devices, it is easy to add new users. Corporations are able to add large amounts of capacity without adding significant infrastructure.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Compatibility with broadband technology </b>- VPN technology is supported by broadband service providers such as DSL and cable, so mobile workers and telecommuters can take advantage of their home high-speed Internet service to access their corporate networks. Business-grade, high-speed broadband connections can also provide a cost-effective solution for connecting remote offices.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are two types of VPN access:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Site-to-site VPNs </b>- Site-to-site VPNs connect entire networks to each other; for example, they can connect a branch office network to a company headquarters network, as shown in Figure 1. Each site is equipped with a VPN gateway, such as a router, firewall, VPN concentrator, or security appliance. In the figure, a remote branch office uses a site-to-site-VPN to connect with the corporate head office. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Remote-access VPNs </b>- Remote-access VPNs enable individual hosts, such as telecommuters, mobile users, and extranet consumers, to access a company network securely over the Internet. Each host (Teleworker 1 and Teleworker 2) typically has VPN client software loaded or uses a web-based client, as shown in Figure 2. </li>
            </ul>
