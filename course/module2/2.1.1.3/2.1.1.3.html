          <p>Every business is unique and how an organization grows depends on many factors. These factors include the type of products or service the business sells, the management philosophy of the owners, and the economic climate of the country in which the business operates. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In slow economic times, many businesses focus on increasing their profitability by improving the efficiency of their existing operations, increasing employee productivity, and lowering operating costs. Establishing and managing networks can represent significant installation and operating expenses. To justify such a large expense, companies expect their networks to perform optimally and to be able to deliver an ever increasing array of services and applications to support productivity and profitability. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The example used in this chapter is of a fictitious company called SPAN Engineering. Watch how its network requirements change as the company grows from a small local business into a global enterprise.</p>
