          <p>IPv6 unique local addresses (ULA) are similar to RFC 1918 private addresses in IPv4, but there are significant differences as well. The intent of ULA is to provide IPv6 address space for communications within a local site; it is not meant to provide additional IPv6 address space, nor is it meant to provide a level of security.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As shown in the figure, ULA have the prefix FC00::/7, which results in a first hextet range of FC00 to FDFF. The next 1 bit is set to 1 if the prefix is locally assigned. Set to 0 may be defined in the future. The next 40 bits is a global ID followed by a 16-bit Subnet ID. These first 64 bits combine to make the ULA prefix. This leaves the remaining 64 bits for the interface ID, or in IPv4 terms, the host portion of the address.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Unique local addresses are defined in RFC 4193. ULAs are also known as local IPv6 addresses (not to be confused with IPv6 link-local addresses) and have several characteristics including: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Allows sites to be combined or privately interconnected, without creating any address conflicts or requiring renumbering of interfaces that use these prefixes.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Independent of any ISP and can be used for communications within a site without having any Internet connectivity.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Not routable across the Internet, however, if accidentally leaked by routing or DNS, there is not conflict with other addresses.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>ULA is not quite as straight-forward as RFC 1918 addresses. Unlike private IPv4 addresses, it has not been the intention of the IETF to use a form of NAT to translate between unique local addresses and IPv6 global unicast addresses. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The implementation and potential uses for IPv6 unique local addresses are still being examined by the Internet community. For example, the IETF is considering allowing the option to have the ULA prefix created locally using FC00::/8, or to have it assigned automatically by a third-party beginning with FD00::/8. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: The original IPv6 specification allocated address space for site-local addresses, defined in RFC 3513. Site-local addresses have been deprecated by the IETF in RFC 3879 because the term “site” was somewhat ambiguous. Site-local addresses had the prefix range of FEC0::/10 and may still be found in some older IPv6 documentation.</p>
