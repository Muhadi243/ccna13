        <h2>Fundamentals of VPNs</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="content">
          <p>Organizations need secure, reliable, and cost-effective ways to interconnect multiple networks, such as allowing branch offices and suppliers to connect to a corporationâ€™s headquarter network. Additionally, with the growing number of teleworkers, enterprises have an increasing need for secure, reliable, and cost-effective ways to connect employees working in small office/home office (SOHO) and other remote locations, with resources on corporate sites.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The figure illustrates the topologies that modern networks use to connect remote locations. In some cases, the remote locations connect only to the headquarters location, while in other cases, remote locations connect to additional sites. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Organizations use VPNs to create an end-to-end private network connection over third-party networks such as the Internet or extranets. The tunnel eliminates the distance barrier and enables remote users to access central site network resources. A VPN is a private network created via tunneling over a public network, usually the Internet. A VPN is a communications environment in which access is strictly controlled to permit peer connections within a defined community of interest.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The first VPNs were strictly IP tunnels that did not include authentication or encryption of the data. For example, Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is a tunneling protocol developed by Cisco that can encapsulate a wide variety of network layer protocol packet types inside IP tunnels. This creates a virtual point-to-point link to Cisco routers at remote points over an IP internetwork. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Today, a secure implementation of VPN with encryption, such as IPsec VPNs, is what is usually meant by virtual private networking.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To implement VPNs, a VPN gateway is necessary. The VPN gateway could be a router, a firewall, or a Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA). An ASA is a standalone firewall device that combines firewall, VPN concentrator, and intrusion prevention functionality into one software image.</p>
