        <h1>Introduction to Frame Relay</h1>
        <h2>Benefits of Frame Relay</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="content">
          <p>Leased lines provide permanent dedicated capacity and are used extensively for building WANs. They have been the traditional connection of choice, but have a number of disadvantages. One disadvantage is that customers pay for leased lines with a fixed capacity. However, WAN traffic is often variable and leaves some of the capacity unused. In addition, each endpoint needs a separate physical interface on the router, which increases equipment costs. Any change to the leased line generally requires a site visit by the carrier personnel.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Frame Relay is a high-performance WAN protocol that operates at the physical and data link layers of the OSI reference model. Unlike leased lines, Frame Relay requires only a single access circuit to the Frame Relay provider to communicate with other sites connected to the same provider. The capacity between any two sites can vary.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Eric Scace, an engineer at Sprint International, invented Frame Relay as a simpler version of the X.25 protocol to use across Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) interfaces. Today, it is also used over a variety of other network interfaces. When Sprint first implemented Frame Relay in its public network, they used StrataCom switches. Ciscoâ€™s acquisition of StrataCom in 1996 marked their entry into the carrier market. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Network providers implement Frame Relay to support voice and data traffic between LANs over a WAN. Each end user gets a private line, or leased line, to a Frame Relay node. The Frame Relay network handles the transmission over a frequently changing path transparent to all end users. As shown in the figure, Frame Relay provides a solution to allow the communications between multiple sites using a single access circuit to the provider.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Historically, Frame Relay was used extensively as a WAN protocol because it was inexpensive compared to dedicated leased lines. In addition, configuring user equipment in a Frame Relay network is very simple. Frame Relay connections are created by configuring customer premise equipment (CPE) routers or other devices to communicate with a service provider Frame Relay switch. The service provider configures the Frame Relay switch, which helps keep end-user configuration tasks to a minimum. </p>
